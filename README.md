# Flax's Arma Server Tool 2 (FAST2)


**CURRENTLY IN CLOSED BETA TESTING**

[Discord Here](https://discord.gg/tkS4evC).

**INTRO**

FAST2 is an extensive rewrite of FAST. The UI needed updating and the code was messy and inefficient. This new and hopefully improved version has more features and better stability than FAST. As before I decided to build FAST to help automate and speed up the deployment of Arma 3 servers on Windows. Thanks go out to all the guys who helped test this version before release with special mentions to Kju and JamieKG for their continuous bug reports and testing. Also, to BI for giving us an awesome game to play with and break.
